Purpose: 
End-to-end operating model for conceiving, designing, testing, and governing enterprise-grade agentic AI systems. Assumes the critical step of prioritization of business use cases based on potential impact has already been done as a separate and prior exercise.

This framework primarily focuses on scaled deployment of agentic AI systems at the enterprise level. The intention is to provide practitioners with a comprehensive playbook from which they can adapt their approach based on the context of their specific use case, and the business environment at the enterprise. As such this framework is designed to be modular and scalable, recognizing that agentic AI systems vary widely in complexity, risk, and context of use. While some projects may only need lightweight, LLM-assisted development, others require full-scale, cross-functional governance and rigorous testing.

It is intended for enterprise leaders and builders working in contexts where trust, compliance, impact measurement, and organizational integration are non-negotiable.
For experimentation or lean use cases, teams may selectively adapt portions of this framework — especially Phase 0 (Human-Centric Discovery), Agentic Epics, and KPI alignment — but are encouraged to evolve toward Enterprise Trust Mode for long-term sustainability.
