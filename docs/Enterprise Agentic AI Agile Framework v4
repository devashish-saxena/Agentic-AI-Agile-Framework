# Enterprise Agentic AIâ€¯Agile Framework v4

# A Comprehensive "People and Processâ€‘First" Playbook

**Release Date: May 2025 License: CC BY 4.0**

**Author: Devashish Saxena (devashishsaxena@gmail.com)**

**Purpose:**

Endâ€‘toâ€‘end operating model for conceiving, designing, testing, and
governing enterpriseâ€‘grade agentic AI systems. Assumes the
prioritization of business use cases based on potential impact has
already been done as a separate exercise.

The framework built is extensive and includes many potential activities
at each phase. The intention is to provide practitioners with a
comprehensive playbook from which they can adapt their approach based on
the context of their specific use case, and the business environment at
the enterprise.

**Audience:**

CDO, CIO, CAIO, CDAIO, Product &â€¯Engineering Leaders, Transformation
PMOs.

**Ensuring Trust in Agentic AI Systems**

> Given that agentic AI systems operate with a degree of autonomy and
> will often interact with real-world systems, data, and potentially
> critical decisions -- it is critical that in enterprise applications
> there is a strong focus on:

1)  **Security**: how is the system protected against malicious attacks
    (e.g. adversarial attacks, data poisoning, prompt injection),
    unauthorized access and data breaches.

2)  **Reliability and Robustness**: how will the system operate
    consistently, accurately, predictably, and handle unexpected inputs
    or failures gracefully.

3)  **Bias and Fairness**: how does the system mitigate unintended
    biases in data or algorithms that could lead to unfair or
    discriminatory outcomes.

4)  **Transparency and Explainability**: how does the end user of such a
    system understand how an agent arrived at its decisions esp. in
    certain regulatory applications such as healthcare or financial.

5)  **Data Privacy and Protection**: how does the system handle
    sensitive data such as PII.

6)  **Accountability**: who is accountable and responsible for the
    outcomes of an agentic system? Which human will be held responsible?
    In traditional systems in the enterprise, IT is often held
    accountable for performance, reliability, robustness of a system --
    how does this evolve for agentic systems that are built on a
    non-deterministic foundation.

7)  **Ethical Considerations**: Adherence to ethical guidelines will
    play a critical role esp. in use cases in health care e.g.

> As an example an enterprise trust posture could be reflected as
> following. However, these could vary based on enterprise and/or use
> case specific trust needs.

- Security grade: **ISOâ€¯27001 mapped**, zero hardâ€‘coded secrets.

- Privacy: **PII redacted at RAG retrieval**; rowâ€‘level ACL.

- Killâ€‘switch SLA: **\< 30â€¯s** tested quarterly.

- Model lifecycle: registry with upgrade checklist.

## 

## Phase 0: Human-Centric Discovery

**Purpose**: Deeply understand the current state: who are the end users,
who are the internal actors, what is the current process, how does it
perform today, what works well, where are the friction points? Keep in
mind the overall objective is to reimagine the process, build agentic AI
based automation and drive the **impact** the business seeks, by
*removing the friction points* for the end users and the internal actors
-- the humans.

**Outcome**: Bundle all Phase 0 artifacts into a **Human First Charter
with baseline impact KPIs/metrics** that feeds Phaseâ€¯1.

## Phase 1. Strategic Agent Blueprint

**Purpose**: Turn the "Human First Charter" from Phase 0 into a
crystal-clear, metrics-anchored direction for the first set of agents to
be built -- defining their purpose, scope and how they will deliver
value whilst adhering to the ethical, risk and legal guard rails with
clear escalation paths in place to humans as needed.

**Outcome**: A formally approved **Strategic Agent Blueprint**
comprising of agentic epic 1-pagers, target KPIs, key guard-rails,
responsibility contracts, solution architecture, technical feasibility,
resource, and budget ballparks.

## Phase 2. Agent Architecture and Integration

**Purpose**: Turn the approved "Strategic Agent Blueprint" from Phase 1
into a detailed, build-ready plan (prompts, memory design, data/tool
wiring, security guard rails, and a validated cost-to-serve forecast).

**Outcome**: A formally approved **Agent Architecture and Integration**
deck comprising of architecture, integration, cost forecast model, and
data quality readiness.

## Phase 3: Agent Behavioral Stress Testing

**Purpose**: Validate agent behavior against functional KPIs and
guard-rails in a fully sandboxed, risk-tiered environment before any
end-user exposure.

**Outcome**: Signed **Ethics-Gate approval plus a Safety Scorecard**
showing accuracy, policy compliance, latency, and cost all within
thresholds---clearing the way for limited human-feedback rollout.

## Phase 4: Human Feedback and Refinement

**Purpose**: Expose the agent to real users in shadow or co-pilot mode,
capture subjective trust signals, refine prompts/tools, and prove
North-Star KPI lift without compromising safety.

**Success factors:** SSAT â‰¥ baseline, override count trending down,
trust cues understood, no unresolved Sev-1 issues.

**Outcome**: Production Go/No-Go decision backed by live SSAT, override,
and cost data; updated prompt/tool version frozen for GA rollout.

## Phase 5: Deployment, Operationalization and Continuous Alignment

**Purpose**: Gradually roll out full autonomy, operate the agent under
defined SLOs, and maintain performance through continuous drift
detection, value realization reviews, and model lifecycle governance.
